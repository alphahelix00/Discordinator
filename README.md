# Discordinator.java
A Java based command framework intended for Discord bots.

**define:** _**Discordinator**_ = *Discord* + *Ordinator* (one who ordains or decrees)

Discordinator is a modularized command framework originally intended for use in conjunction with other Discord APIs (such as Discord4J).
However, it can also be easily adapted for use in any other project.

#Functionality
- Annotated command definitions with multiple command prefix support
- Support for a "main" command and (optional) "sub-commands" that are called after the main command
- **To-do list:**
  - Add support for registering commands in forms other than annotations (e.g. builder, read from files)

#Contribution
Discordinator is still a **[Work In Progress]**

For those of you who are interested seeing this project improve, all contributions are appreciated!
Also feel free to drop me a PM on Discord <*@alpha;helix*> if there are any questions, comments, or concerns (throw me a mention in the Discord API server)!
